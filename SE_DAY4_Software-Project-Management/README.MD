4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
When Agile is More Beneficial
Agile is best for projects that require flexibility, continuous feedback, and iterative development. Examples include:

Software Development – Apps and web platforms  
Startups & Tech Innovations – Products evolving based on user feedback (e.g., new AI tools).
Marketing Campaigns – Strategies that need constant adjustments.
When Waterfall is More Beneficial
Waterfall works best for projects with fixed requirements, clear timelines, and minimal changes. Examples include:

Construction Projects – Building a bridge or skyscraper.
Government or Compliance-Heavy Software – Banking systems, medical records management.
Manufacturing & Hardware Development – Designing a new car or circuit board.

5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance in a Software Project
Automated Testing – Use tools like Selenium or Jest to catch errors early.

Code Reviews – Regular peer reviews to maintain code quality.
Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD) – Automate testing and deployment.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Ensure the software meets user expectations.
Bug Tracking & Resolution – Use tools like Jira or Trello to manage issues.
Clear Documentation – Maintain well-structured project and testing documentation.
Importance of Maintaining High Standards
Enhances User Satisfaction – Ensures a smooth and reliable user experience.
Reduces Costs – Fixing bugs early is cheaper than post-release fixes.
Improves Security – Prevents vulnerabilities and potential breaches.
Increases System Stability – Minimizes crashes and performance issues.
Builds Brand Reputation – Reliable software attracts more users and clients.
